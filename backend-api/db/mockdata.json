          "body": "Danielle, Natalie, Rob, and Patrick settle in for an in-depth discussion of \"puddlegate\"—the kerfuffle that occurred when some gamers thought the new Spider-Man game on PS4 had downgraded visuals compared to its E3 showing. We talk about tech fetishism, elitism, and entitlement, alongside social media frenzies and the media's role in it all. Then, we hit the question bucket and sign off for the weekend.\n\n\n\nDiscussed: Marvel's Spider-Man, PC gaming, Detroit:Become Human, Horizon: Zero Dawn, Yakuza, The Witcher 3, Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Bad Company 2, Red Faction 2, Dead Cells.\n\n\n\nYou can subscribe on iTunes, Google Play, and Stitcher.

          "body": "CLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n    During the third day of Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation hearing, Senator Cory Booker challenged his colleagues to try and expel him for breaking a rule that he opposes by releasing confidential emails.\n    USA TODAY\n\n\n\nSen. Cory Booker was among several Democratic senators who called for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing to be postponed.(Photo: U.S. Senate)\n\n\nWASHINGTON – Sen. Cory Booker had what will be remembered as his “Spartacus moment” during Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings this week when he faced down Republicans over the nominee’s contribution to an email chain with “racial profiling” in the subject line.\nThe 2002 emails were no smoking gun. Republicans, in fact, argued that they showed Kavanaugh working in President George W. Bush’s White House to protect Americans in the months after 9/11 through increased screening of passengers at airports.\nBut for Booker, a potential 2020 presidential hopeful, the substance of the emails wasn’t the point. Benign as they were, the emails gave him a platform for defiance as he dared the GOP to try to expel him for reading aloud some of the documents that Senate Judiciary Committee’s leadership had deemed “confidential.”\nThe Democratic senator from New Jersey commanded the spotlight when he slammed what he called a “sham process” by the GOP to put Kavanaugh on a fast track for confirmation. His Democratic colleagues promised to back him up if he was punished for breaking the rules, leading Booker to liken himself to Tony Curtis, who declared ‘I am Spartacus' in the 1960 movie classic.\nThe hearings were a test for Booker along with two other Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee seen as potential 2020 contenders: Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.\nBooker’s declaration Thursday morning came after Harris, in an exchange that went viral on social media, pressed Kavanaugh on whether he had discussed special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe with a law firm headed by Marc Kasowitz, who has advised President Donald Trump. “You don’t want to tell us,” she chastised the nominee.\nStanding up or grandstanding?\nThe GOP’s response to Booker’s outburst evolved. Initially, a senator questioned whether Booker \"deserves to sit on this committee or in the Senate\" for what he did. Then the documents he wanted were cleared for release, so they were no longer confidential when Booker put them out. So the response shifted to mocking Booker's \"Spartacus\" comment and arguing he was grandstanding over nothing.\nBooker's team responded by continuing to release more \"confidential\" documents about issues such as affirmative action in university admissions and Kavanaugh's dealings with a Republican who hacked Senate Democrats' computers throughout the day.\nThere was no sign, however, any of it had an effect on the outcome of the nomination.\nThe emails were among of thousands of documents relating to Kavanaugh's service in  Bush's White House that were labeled \"committee confidential\" by the panel's chairman, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.\nWithin the email chain on screening of passengers at airports. Kavanaugh wrote that he and others favor “effective security measures that are race neutral,” a phrase highlighted by his supporters. But he also appeared to accept the need to start screening before comprehensive standards to prevent profiling were developed, which Booker questioned. \nAs a committee member, Booker was allowed to read the emails, but he could not talk about or share them unless he asked for permission in advance. That, of course, would have tipped Republicans that Booker would raise profiling at the hearings.\nOn Wednesday night, Booker broke the first rule, reading from the emails before asking Kavanaugh what he thought about profiling today. Kavanaugh asked to see the email and Booker did not provide it. \nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, objected. He said Booker should not be able to ask a witness about a document without the witness being able to see it, and that Booker was quoting a confidential document.\nLee, who has worked closely with Booker on sentencing reform legislation despite their wide differences on other issues, offered to work with the Democrat to make the document public, and Booker thanked him.\nAttitudes were more testy the next morning. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, complained that it was \"outrageous\" Democrats would try to question Kavanaugh about a document he could not see, and also that they would not respect a decision President Bush and his lawyer had made to keep legal advice he got confidential.\nMore: Booker releases confidential 'racial profiling' Kavanaugh emails\nMore: Cory Booker grills Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nMore: Read the confidential Brett Kavanaugh 'racial profiling' emails Cory Booker released\n\"It's important that we remind one another that there are clear rules about the discussion of confidential material and that there can be consequences to the violations,\" Cornyn said.\nBooker responded by criticizing the rules and saying he would make the emails public even if that meant he faced expulsion, calling it an act of \"civil disobedience.\" Several Democratic colleagues said they would stand with him. \n'Irresponsible and dangerous'\nCornyn said it was \"irresponsible and dangerous\" for a senator to decide to release classified information \"because you happen to disagree with the classification decision.\"\n\"Running for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate,\" Cornyn said. At another point, Cornyn read a Senate rule Booker may have violated. Booker challenged him, asking if he was expressing \"political bluster or sincere feelings.\"\n\"If he feels that I, and now my fellow colleagues who are with me, have violated those rules, if he's not a tempest in a teapot, but sincerely believes that, then bring the charges,\" he said. \nSpeaking to reporters later outside the hearing room, Booker questioned whether Cornyn was trying to bully him, telling the Texan to \"bring it\" if he wasn't. Those two words morphed into a Twitter hashtag, promoted by his media team. One Tweet combined pictures of Booker with Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi.\nBob Bland, co-chairman of the Women's March, a group that staged a sit-in Thursday at  Grassley's office, released a statement saying: “Senator Booker is modeling exactly what we expect of every member of the Senate: we need to stop Kavanaugh by any means necessary.\"\nKristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said Booker's effort highlighted how “shrouded in secrecy” the confirmation process has been even if the emails did not contain a smoking gun that undid Kavanaugh's nomination.  Clarke said the point was that they had been classified to keep Democrats from bringing them up, even thought they contained no information that merited secrecy.\n“I think this morning was a game-changer,” Clarke said. “What other information is in the hundreds of thousands of documents that haven’t been turned over? There is a looming feeling there is something they’re hiding.”\nBooker had to know that expulsion would never happen when he invited it. To begin with, that penalty requires 67 votes, meaning 16 of his fellow Democrats would have to join in the vote.\nMore importantly, by the time his office distributed the racial profiling email, the committee had worked with administration lawyers and agreed to waived confidentiality.\n\"We were surprised to learn about Senator Booker's histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly,\" Bill Burk, Bush's records representative on Kavanaugh papers, said in a statement.\nBooker's office responded by releasing more documents throughout the day.\n“Senate Republicans are doing everything they can to distract from their sham process,\" Booker spokesman Krisitin Lynch.\n“Cory and Senate Democrats were able to shame the committee into agreeing to make last night’s documents publicly available, and Cory publicly released those documents as well as other committee confidential documents today. And he’ll keep releasing them because Republicans are hiding Brett Kavanaugh’s record from the American people,” Lynch said.\n \n \nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2MYnKG3",

John McCain with his wife, Cindy, at his side, acknowledges his supporters after giving his concession speech at the Arizona Biltmore Resort in Phoenix on Nov. 4, 2008.(Photo: Michael Chow/The Republic)\n\n\nCindy McCain made an emotional plea Friday in an op-ed in USA TODAY for Americans to honor her late husband, Arizona Sen. John McCain, by following his example and fighting for a cause greater than themselves. \n\"This was the essence of John McCain’s message to our nation,\" she said. \"We must join together, shaped by our deepest values of liberty, equal justice, and respect for the dignity of all people, hardened by unwavering courage and integrity, and step into the arena to fight for a greater cause.\" \nFrom his military service to his time in Congress, John McCain spent his life fighting for his ideals, Cindy said. \"With his passing, America inherently understood that this is the kind of leadership we want. That this is the kind of country we want to be.\" \nMcCain, 81, died last month from brain cancer and was honored in a series of moving services. Cindy McCain said thousands of people have asked how they best can honor his legacy.\n\"I’ll tell you how,\" she said. \"Join me in the arena. Fight for a greater cause.\" \nShe urged people to support the work of the McCain Institute for International Leadership, where \"we will pay his legacy forward.\" The McCain Institute is based in Washington, D.C., and is run in partnership with Arizona State University. The self-described \"do-tank\" aims to advance \"character-driven global leadership,\" promote democracy and human rights, keep a strong national defense, and serve \"causes greater than one’s self-interest.\" \nMore: Sen. John McCain's farewell letter: 'I lived and died a proud American'\nMore: McCain funeral at National Cathedral: Tributes to the late Arizona senator\nMcCain was a Republican throughout his political career, but his identity as a \"maverick\" who was willing to put country above party earned him admiration from across the political spectrum. \n\"So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty,\" former President Barack Obama said at McCain's funeral. \"Trafficking in bombast and insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage. It's politics that pretends to be brave and tough, but in fact is born of fear. John called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that.\"\nFormer President George W. Bush said, \"Wherever John passed throughout the world, people immediately knew there was a leader in their midst. In one epic life was written the courage and greatness of our country.\" \nAutoplay\nShow Thumbnails\nShow Captions\n\nLast SlideNext Slide\n\n\n \nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2Ns3HPN",

          "body": "CLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n    Former President Barack Obama is throwing his weight behind a long list of Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections.\n    USA TODAY\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON – Former President Barack Obama will preview his midterm campaign message with a speech Friday morning in his home state, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n“He will echo his call to reject the rising strain of authoritarian politics and policies,\" said Katie Hill, Obama's communications director. \"And he will preview arguments he’ll make this fall, specifically that Americans must not fall victim to our own apathy by refusing to do the most fundamental thing demanded of us as citizens: vote.\"\nObama delivered a series of speeches in the final year of his presidency warning of threats to the strength of democracy. Hill said he will expand on the theme that \"America is at its best when our democracy is inclusive and our citizens are engaged.\"\nMore: These are the women candidates making history in 2018\nMore: Civil rights groups on high alert for cyberthreats\nThe speech comes ahead of his first midterm campaign events, beginning Saturday in the political battleground of Orange County, Calif., where he will campaign for several Democratic House candidates.\n“Democrats need all hands on deck to take back the House, and we could not be more honored to have President Barack Obama’s inspirational voice and unifying message on the campaign trail, with his first stop in Southern California,\" Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a statement. \nNational Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Steve Stivers said on Friday that Obama's campaign events actually help Republicans.\n\"For three cycles President Obama fired up Republicans like nobody and I’m happy if he wants to do it again,\" he said at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast.\nObama will head to Cleveland on Sept. 13 to campaign for Ohio Democratic gubernatorial nominee Richard Cordray. He will also campaign this month in Illinois and Pennsylvania, and will headline a fundraiser for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee in New York City.\nLast month, Obama released a first round of endorsements – 81 candidates up and down the ballot – and there will be a second round of endorsements and additional campaign activity in advance of the midterms, according to his office.\nHill said Obama hopes to use his standing across the country to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot. \n“He will make a pointed case in his speech on Friday, and on the trail this fall, that this moment in our country is too perilous for Democratic voters to sit out,\" she said.\nObama’s planned re-emergence comes as both parties are girding for a November election widely seen as a referendum on President Donald Trump. The outcome will decide control of Congress and three dozen gubernatorial contests.\nAnalysts say Obama's post-presidential star status among Democrats will help drive turnout among African-American, Latino and young voters in key suburban House districts and cities. They also said he is better positioned than almost anyone else in the party to raise huge amounts of campaign cash.  \nObama left office with a 57 percent approval rating, and like most presidents, his standing has only improved since departing the West Wing. More than six in 10 respondents to a Gallup poll released in February said they approved of the way Obama handled the job. \nFormer First Lady Michelle Obama, a co-chair of the group When We All Vote, is also getting involved. She is urging Americans to participate in a week of action, Sept. 22 through 29, to get people registered to vote.\n\"My father taught me that voting is a sacred responsibility, one that none of us can take for granted,\" she tweeted last month. \"And #WhenWeAllVote, we can make our voices heard.\" \nContributing: John Fritze\n \nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2NqQSVT",

          "body": "CBS boss Les Moonves sought to undermine Janet Jackson's career after the infamous \"wardrobe malfunction\" incident at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show, according to a HuffPost report. \nMultiple sources told HuffPost that Moonves considered Jackson \"not sufficiently repentant\" for the incident and subsequently banned her music from MTV, VH1, and other Viacom-owned properties. \nMoonves is reportedly in settlement talks to leave CBS, with the board offering around $100 million amid an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against him.\n\n\nLes Moonves, the embattled CEO of CBS, reportedly sought to ban Janet Jackson from MTV and Viacom-owned properties, and undermine her career, after the infamous \"wardrobe malfunction\" incident that took place at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show, according to HuffPost report.\nMultiple unnamed sources told HuffPost that Moonves considered Jackson \"not sufficiently repentant\" for the incident, in which Justin Timberlake ripped away a piece of Jackson's leather outfit during the halftime show and left her breast exposed for \"9/16 of a second\" on live TV. \nCBS and the halftime show's producer, MTV, which were both under the parent company Viacom at the time, faced criticism and a $550,000 fine from the Federal Communications Commission. Moonves said in a statement following the incident that CBS was \"angry and embarrassed\" by the malfunction. \nThough Timberlake and Jackson both said at the time that the incident was a true malfunction, Moonves banned both artists from appearing on the 2004 Grammy Awards broadcast by CBS.\nAccording to HuffPost's sources, Timberlake \"tearfully apologized\" for the incident and was allowed to perform at the Grammys, but Moonves was \"furious that Jackson didn't make a similarly contrite apology to him,\" and subsequently sought to further undercut her career. \nMoonves reportedly ordered a ban on Jackson's music on MTV, VH1, and other Viacom-owned properties, which adversely affected the sales of Jackson's March 2004 album \"Damita Jo.\" \nHuffPost's sources said that they felt that Moonves \"played a large part\" in how the public perceived Jackson in the aftermath of an event that significantly damaged her career. \nSeven years after the incident, Moonves was reportedly \"furious\" and \"aggressive\" in tone to several sources after Jackson signed a book deal with Simon & Schuster (which is owned by Viacom) for her 2011 memoir \"True You.\"\nMoonves is reportedly in settlement talks to leave CBS, with the board offering around $100 million amid an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against him, which appeared in a New Yorker report in July. NBC News also reported that Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of both CBS and Viacom, has been seeking a possible replacement for Moonves.\nCBS declined to comment on HuffPost's report. Representatives for CBS also declined to comment to Business Insider, and Jackson's reps did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

The company plans to triple its supplies towards this segment in the next five years. According to the 2020 BS-VI norms, stainless steel is the most preferred metal for exhausts , the weight of which will increase from 20 to 40 kgs in commercial vehicles,” a statement issued by the company in the backdrop of the 58th Annual Convention being organized by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) in Delhi. The event focused on issues influencing Indian automotive industry’s competitiveness and its integration with the global economy.Commenting on the potential of stainless steel usage in the automotive industry, JSL’s Head Sales, Vijay Sharma said: “The Indian automobile sector is rising fast with an annual growth rate of 15% registered in FY18. Jindal Stainless registered a 25% growth in this sector. While developed nations deploy 19% stainless steel in motor vehicles, developing countries consume it to the tune of 5%”.Stainless steel is used in vital auto components such as vehicle exhaust, disk brakes, catalytic converters and specialized parts of diesel turbochargers. Apart from this, it can also be used in fuel tanks and bus bodies. Owing to India’s long coast line, stainless steel is the best choice for making bus body frames and panels, ensuring longevity in these highly corrosive environments, the company said.",

          "body": "Boris Johnson must now split his millions with his wife Marina as they rush through their divorce - but he will not be punished for his alleged philandering.\n\nThe Foreign Secretary, 54, who is believed to have at least £6.5million in cash and assets, will share half of everything he has because they have been married for 25 years.\n\nBut Mr Johnson's alleged cheating will not have any impact on the settlement, even though he is alleged to have had at least three affairs since he married Marina in 1993, legal experts have told MailOnline.\n\nThe couple own a grand Islington townhouse worth at least £4million plus a country home in Oxfordshire with an estimated value of £1million.\n\nMr Johnson, who is paid £275,000-a-year for a weekly Daily Telegraph column and has written bestselling history books, is said to have a personal wealth of at least £1.5million.\n\nDivorce expert David Leadercramer, a partner at law firm DMH Stallard, told MailOnline: 'If the assets total in all say £6.5 million then Marina would look at getting half.\n\n'If £3.25million gave her enough for a home and to meet her day to day needs then she would not usually look for maintenance in addition. They would simply divide assets equally on what is known as a clean break'.\n\nMarina reportedly kicked her husband out amid claims he had another affair.\n\nThe Tory MP has also cheated in the past but this will not be taken into account in any settlement.\n\nMr Leadercramer said: 'In order to bring in conduct it has to be exceptional, such as trying to kill the other spouse, but serial adulterers are not made to pay in that sense for their \"misdeeds\". I have little or no doubt that in this case his conduct won't affect the financial issues at all'.\n\nLast year it was claimed that Boris Johnson told friends his then minister's salary of £141,405 a year is not enough to live on.\n\nThe Foreign Secretary told friends his annual earnings were insufficient because of his 'extensive family responsibilities', according to The Sunday Times.\n\nThe Tory MP has four children with Marina Wheeler and a daughter from his affair with Helen MacIntyre.\n\nIn law children all require his financial support if they are in full time education or under 25 and not working.\n\nBoris and his wife today announced that they separated 'several months ago' and are divorcing.\n\nThe rift emerged when his daughter Lara, 25, was apparently overheard calling her father a 'selfish b*****' and insisting her mother would now 'never take him back'.\n\nTheir split was announced as it was claimed the Brexit cheerleader is poised to make a bid to replace Theresa May as PM with sources calling it a 'damage limitation exercise' rather than a 'stitch up'.\n\nOne Tory MP claimed today the news was all a case of 'shovelling the s*** out of the way for the leadership bid'.\n\nToday Boris looked serious and refused to comment as he left his country home in Oxfordshire minutes before the couple announced their marriage was over.\n\nIn a joint personal statement Mr Johnson and Ms Wheeler said: 'Several months ago, after 25 years of marriage, we decided it was in our best interests to separate.\n\n'We have subsequently agreed to divorce and that process is under way. As friends we will continue to support our four children in the years ahead. We will not be commenting further'.\n\nMr Johnson and his lawyer wife Marina Wheeler, both 54, now live apart and no longer socialise as a couple, it was claimed.\n\nHe has already been thrown out twice before, first in 2004 over his affair with writer Petronella Wyatt, and again in 2010 when he fathered a love child with art consultant Helen Macintyre.\n\nIn the past Mrs Wheeler, mother to their four children, has taken him back, despite his philandering. Sources close to Mr Johnson refused last night to comment.\n\nThe MP's daughter Lara, 25, was overheard at a party ranting about her father's infidelity, saying her mother would 'never take him back', The Sun said.\n\nShe added: 'Mum is finished with him.' She is said to have told pals at a party he 'is a selfish b******'.",

He further stressed that nothing good has come from America’s \"aggression\" and thus after the liberation of Idlib, the last terrorists' stronghold in Syria, a large US contingent controlling northern Syria should be withdrawn, according to Rouhani.\n\nApart from the illegal American presence, Israeli \"occupational regime\" must also leave the country, Rouhani added citing international resolutions and the demands of the Syrians. The Iranian president did not elaborate, but he was apparently referring to the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, a strategic plateau captured from Syria in a six-day 1967 war. Tel-Aviv's de-facto control and claims over the area has not been recognized by the UN.\n\nIsrael has been bombing Syrian territory under the pretext of striking Iranian targets, and the IDF recently admitted that, over the past 18 months, it has carried out more than 200 strikes. Tel-Aviv claims that Tehran is trying use Syria's territory to vastly extend its influence in the Middle East despite the fact that Iranian forces were deployed there after an invitation from Damascus. Notably, US troops were never granted permission from Syrian authorities, who repeatedly slammed Washington for their deployment.\n\nIranian forces are not going to leave Syria and will continue fight against terrorism, Rouhani announced, adding that stability in the war-torn country cannot be reached without anti-terrorism efforts in Idlib. At the same time, civilians should not suffer from the operation in the area, he said.\n\nThink your friends would be interested? Share this story!",

A total of 38 capsules will be available, it says.\nEach capsule has a bed, TV, storage space and power plugs. There is also a communal area with a kitchen equipped with several microwave ovens, a lounge and bathrooms. The monthly rent of €200 (£180; $235) includes bills and wifi, the company's website says.\nThey are significantly smaller than shipping containers, which have been converted into low-cost housing in several locations around the world and come in two sizes, offering 15 sq m or 30 sq m of floor space.\nWho would live in them?\nThe pods would be rented to people aged between 25 and 45 who had a minimum salary of €450. About 500 people have shown an interest, the company says.\n\n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                 Image copyright\n                 Getty Images\n                \n            \n            \n            \n                Image caption\n                \n                    The Haibu pods are inspired by Japan's capsule hotels\n                \n            \n            \n        People are social creatures meant to live in supportive communities, the website adds. However the rules stipulate that no more than one person is allowed to live in a pod and people are not allowed to have sex in them \"in order to maintain respect for the others living there\".\nVictoria Cerdan, one of the entrepreneurs behind the project, told AFP news agency the pods would enable people who could not afford available housing to \"band together and move ahead\".\n\"Obviously it is not adequate housing, no one would want it for themselves,\" she said. \"But no one wants a monthly salary of 500 euros and unfortunately they exist. Instead of living on the street, we offer this.\"\nAnother partner at Haibu, Edi Wattenwil, told El País that the pods aimed to provide accommodation with greater privacy than could be found in hostels with several beds to a room.\n\"Citizens who are going through a difficult financial period should not have to sleep out on the streets or in a hostel. Our company lets them live with dignity...\"\nDoes it fill a gap in the market?\nIt comes against a background of soaring rents in big Spanish cities. In Barcelona the average rent for a flat rose by nearly a third between 2014 and 2017 to just over €900, AFP reports.\nThe company says it is ready to move its project to another European city with similarly high rents such as Copenhagen, Paris or Rome if the Barcelona authorities do not allow it to operate, El País reports.",

There's no nasty surprises and you will never have to pay for an update again.\n\nThose preferring System Mechanic Pro can do the same for a lifetime's use of the service, including:\n\n\nPatented technology for maximum speed, power, and stability\n\n\nRemoval of frustrating errors, crashes, and freezes\n\n\nCertified virus protection and data security",

          "body": "NEW DELHI: India can cut its annual oil import bill by some Rs 1.2 lakh crore in the next five to seven years by switching its two-wheelers from internal combustion engine to electric, according to the NITI Aayog \"India has over 170 million two-wheelers. If we assume that each of these vehicles uses a little more than half a litre of petrol per day or about 200 litres per year, the total amount of petrol used by such vehicles is about 34 billion litres,\" said the NITI Aayog's 'Zero Emission Vehicles: Towards a Policy Framework' report released on Friday.\"At Rs 70 per litre, this would cost about Rs 2.4 lakh crore. Even if we assume that 50 per cent of this is the cost of imported crude (as tax and other may be 50 per cent), one may save Rs 1.2 lakh crore worth of imported oil,\" it said.The report added there was a real possibility of getting this done in the next five to seven years, but it would require a policy regime that encourages access to latest technologies and which systematically ensures that India's electric vehicle program keeps pace with the global scale.Incidentally, minutes before releasing the report, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the government will soon put in place a new stable policy regime to promote the use of electric and other alternative-fuel vehicles in the country to fight climate change The NITI Aayog report said that India had a lot to gain by converting its internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles at the earliest.\"Its oil-import bill would considerably reduce. Internal combustion engine vehicles are a major contributor to pollution in cities and their replacement with electric vehicles will definitely improve air quality. There is a considerable possibility that we can become leaders in small and public electric vehicles,\" it said.\"This would however require innovations, a policy regime that encourages access to latest technologies and a concerted effort by the Indian industry to achieve global competition through acquiring the necessary scale and using cutting edge technology,\" it added.Earlier, at the inauguration of the two-day 'Move: Global Mobility Summit' where the report was officially released, the Prime Minister said that in a rapidly transforming mobility paradigm, India had inherent strength and comparative advantages over other major economies.With fewer vehicles per capita than other major economies, India does not carry much of the baggage of other economies that were built on the back of private car ownership, Modi said.\"This gives us a window of opportunity to create an all new seamless mobility ecosystem,\" he added.",

          "body": "NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation on Friday filed a chargesheet against journalist Upendra Rai and his associate Rahul Sharma for allegedly portraying himself as a “power broker” in the I-T department and extorting Rs 15 crore from a Mumbai based real estate company.Interestingly, despite naming “unknown” I-T department officials in its FIR registered in May first week, CBI has not named any government official in its chargesheet.One Balvinder Singh Malhotra, director of Mumbai based M/s White Lion Real Estate Developers Pvt Ltd, had approached the agency in May with a complaint against Rai.It was alleged that Rai approached Kapil Wadhawan, a relative of the promoters of the company, in September 2017 portraying himself as a “power broker” of I-T department and other government departments.Rai had also impressed on Wadhawan that he is a senior journalist having worked for Tehelka, Star TV and is connected to big media houses. He further informed Wadhawan that he had sensitive information from the I-T department relating to the raids to be conducted on the companies related/associated to White Lion, adding that action would be taken against the company under Benami Act as well.Subsequently, he threatened that he had the potential to tarnish the image of the White Lion companies and promoters due to his media connections.Finally, Wadhawan met Rai at his GK-1 Delhi residence during which Rai showed him a bunch of documents of I-T department wherein action was contemplated against various companies including White Lion. “This was followed by few calls from local media persons,” alleged CBI.“Upendra Rai demanded huge amount of money to settle the issue with I-T department and adverse media reporting. He claimed he had contacts in I-T office, Scindia House, Mumbai,” the agency alleges.“Succumbing to the pressure, a consultancy agreement had to be signed to work out an arrangement to pay the huge amount demanded. Thus, a consultancy agreement dated October 3, 2017 was prepared between M/s Upendra Rai and Associates and White Lion from October 1, 2017 till September 30, 2018,” it adds.As per the agreement, sum of Rs 15,19,50,000 (excluding GST and TDS) has been paid from Axis Bank Bandra account (of company) to Rai’s HDFC Bank account between October 2017 and April 2018, says CBI.The company later realized that Upendra Rai is a professional blackmailer and a tout in various government department, include I-T. Thus, White Lion discontinued the agreement.CBI has chargesheet him and Sharma for criminal conspiracy and prevention of corruption act.",

                  "NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation on Friday filed a chargesheet against journalist Upendra Rai and his associate Rahul Sharma for allegedly portraying himself as a “power broker” in the I-T department and extorting Rs 15 crore from a Mumbai based real estate company.Interestingly, despite naming “unknown” I-T department officials in its FIR registered in May first week, CBI has not named any government official in its chargesheet.One Balvinder Singh Malhotra, director of Mumbai based M/s White Lion Real Estate Developers Pvt Ltd, had approached the agency in May with a complaint against Rai.It was alleged that Rai approached Kapil Wadhawan, a relative of the promoters of the company, in September 2017 portraying himself as a “power broker” of I-T department and other government departments.Rai had also impressed on Wadhawan that he is a senior journalist having worked for Tehelka, Star TV and is connected to big media houses.",

They have been integrated and a CCTV-like feed will be given to the border post and immediate action can be taken against any intrusion attempt.\"This (Dhubri) is almost completed and likely to be inaugurated on September 27.

THAT ENDS TODAY.\"\n\nIn the statements, he makes claims that Kelis is keeping him away from their child Knight, and accuses her of mental and physical abuse. \"I instilled strength in my daughter who you were already so jealous of and treated poorly. Being jealous and verbally abusive to a little girl,\" he wrote.\n\nAccording to Nas, the singer has continued to be abusive even after their divorce. \"After 10 years of keeping my silence during a decade of dealing with very hostile behavior and verbal abuse and even your stepfather holding you back from one of your physical violent attacks on me right outside your house this year while trying to pick up our son while he watched from the window.\" The rapper claims over the course of their relationship she'd done this publicly, in front of their staff who can't speak on the abuse they've seen due to NDA's.\n\nNas's response doesn't do much to provide fans with a better sense of what went on in their five-year marriage. The rapper avoided the scandal on NASIR, released this June. In his final caption, Nas says this is the first and last time he'll speak on the allegations.\n\nA representative for Nas said that he had no additional comment aside from his Instagram post. Noisey reached out to representatives for Kelis, but they have yet to respond at press time.\n\nKristin Corry is a staff writer for Noisey. Follow her on Twitter.",

They all initially denied involvement in the fly-tipping.\n\nA council spokesman said: \"However, Naseem Rafiq was found to have borrowed a red fork lift truck from one of the businesses on their Park on the Friday evening before the CCTV-captured incident and returned it in the early hours of the day the incident was recorded – but when questioned did not explain why.\"\n\nThe three men and business were prosecuted at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Friday, August 31:\n\nIkram Properties Ltd pleaded guilty to the separate offences; depositing controlled waste, f ailing to comply with a statutory demand to supply information regarding the deposit of controlled waste and o bstructing an authorised person in the exercise of his powers by making false representations.\n\nIt was handed a £15,500 fine, plus a further £10,000 in costs and a victim surcharge of £170\n\nNaseem Rafiq, aged 46 of Upland Road, Selly Park, pleaded guilty to depositing controlled waste contrary to S.33 & S.34(6) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. He was given a £4,430 fine, plus £2,000 court costs and a £170 victim surcharge.\n\nVaseem Rafiq , aged 45 of Aubrey Road, Small Heath, pleaded guilty to o bstructing an authorised person in the exercise of his powers by making false representations, contrary to S.110(1) of the Environment Act 1995. He was given a £4,250 fine, plus £2,000 court costs and £170 victim surcharge.\n\nNaheam Rafiq, aged 47 of Billesley Lane, Moseley, pleaded guilty to o bstructing an authorised person in the exercise of his powers by making false representations, contrary to S.110(1) of the Environment Act 1995. He was given a £4,250 fine, plus £2,000 court costs and £170 victim surcharge.\n\nCouncil cabinet member for cleaner streets Majid Mahmood said: \"We know from resident surveys that clean streets are the number one priority for the people of Birmingham. We will do everything we can to offer a modern, effective and efficient waste management service.\n\n“Individual citizens to businesses of all sizes have a role to play in ensuring clean streets in Birmingham. But we know there is a small minority who do not share this aim. Legal action is always a last resort, but we will use it wherever necessary.”",

Yonger told Spectrum News in Rochester: “I ain’t nothing without my wife.” He’s been married to his wife, Waverlee, for more than 50 years.\nRecently, a CBS reporter joined Yonger on one of his daily treks to see Waverlee and discovered that this Korean War veteran doesn’t just walk every day – he runs.\n“He warned me I would have to keep up with him, and I was sure that I could. I wasn't prepared for a man in his 90s to start running, but he did — several times,” reporter Caitlin O’Kane writes.\nHe even does pushups, she reports.\nThe devoted husband just turned 99.\nMore: Generation Z predicts the future: America's kids explain love, marriage and gender roles\nWaverlee is paralyzed and has been battling brain cancer since 2009, Spectrum News reports.\nThe couple’s only daughter Lutheta said her mother is scheduled to be released from the hospital. She will “live out the rest of her days home,” she said earlier this week in a post on a GoFundMe set up to cover the family’s medical expenses.\nThere's no doubt that Luther Yonger will be by her side.

          "body": "The bride and groom stand before a small gathering of guests in the backyard of a home once owned by Frank Sinatra, the San Fernando Valley stretching out below them as their wedding celebrant invites the couple to kiss. Jeff Baleja leans down to embrace his new wife, Serena, as their gathered friends and family applaud, then reaches into his left pocket to retrieve a small container.\n\n‘You may now smoke with the bride,’ the celebrant says, as the groom pulls out two enormous joints. Jeff and Serena light them from the same flame provided by the celebrant and inhale deeply, the California sun beginning to set behind them.\n\nTheir shared marital marijuana is not the only time the plant surfaces during the wedding; cannabis is, in fact, a central theme of the day. The groom is a marijuana chef who’s starting a company to produce cannabis-infused vegan popsicles, and the wedding is peppered with weed, from the decorations to the food to the recreational offerings on hand.\n\nSerena’s bouquet and Jeff’s boutonniere feature marijuana leaves, and guests are invited to try an assortment of weed-infused treats; tables manned by ‘budtenders’ display rolled joints, edibles, cartridges and other options. Even the chocolate fountain is infused with cannabis, and many of the nearly 40 guests partake.\n\nJeff, 29, and Serena, 27, say that cannabis consumption has been central to their relationship, and they couldn’t imagine their big day without it. And they’re not alone; as more and more states legalize marijuana, the demand for weed at weddings is growing.\n\n‘It’s very important that we share cannabis together and our guests,’ Jeff tells DailyMail.com at the reception. ‘It’s just a bonding moment; it’s very important.’\n\n‘I think cannabis spreads a lot of happiness, and you can see it when you look around the wedding,’ his new bride says, with a tranquil smile.\n\nJeff’s native California is one of nine states that has legalized both medical and recreational use of marijuana; it’s legal for medical purposes in 21 others. The demand for cannabis celebrations first surfaced in the trailblazing state of Colorado a few years ago, prompting one entrepreneur, Bec Koop, to not only tailor her floral business to the demand but also to begin a cannabis wedding expo which has now spread from Colorado to California and Nevada.\n\nShe came up with the idea for the event, she says, ‘because of the fact that I was turned down from a traditional expo.’\n\nShe tells DailyMail.com: ‘I had a traditional expo tell me: “Absolutely, hell no.” I had another one tell me: “Sure, but we’re going to charge you double, even from the price that was listed on the website.” And then there was another that told me we could only bring photos of what we do; we could not even bring a bouquet that had cannabis in it or anything along those lines – even if it was fake cannabis [if] it looked too much like the real deal.’\n\nShe says she joked around with another cannabis entrepreneur, Philip Wolf, that they should start their own expo. The joke turned into reality, and the expo debuted in Denver in 2016 with about 25 vendors; by the second year, that number had tripled.\n\nThe event expanded to Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay area, and next year – the fourth year of the expo – will include Las Vegas.\n\nOne of the vendors earlier this year in Los Angeles was Ohio native Jamie Lee McCormick, who grew up around flowers in his mother’s shop in Ohio. He started his own California business, The Flower Daddy, and specializes in cannabis weddings – and he was hired by Serena and Jeff to plan a whirlwind wedding after their engagement just over six weeks ago.\n\n‘We always smoked together and have been involved in this growing industry over here, and it kind of is like, why wouldn’t you want to smoke at your wedding?’ says Serena, a London native who works in social media marketing. ‘We didn’t really ever envision a wedding without this because of how involved it is in our lives and how often we partake.\n\n‘So it just felt really natural … it’s now legal; why wouldn’t we have a marijuana bar next to our usual bar? And as soon as I found out that this is a plausible thing that can happen, I wanted to run with it.’\n\nShe sought out a wedding planner that would ‘have experience in finding a venue and all of the ins and outs and legalities’ of such an event, settling on The Flower Daddy.\n\n‘I’ve always been a huge cannabis advocate and plus a user, and I’ve always been a huge connoisseur of cannabis and I’ve always wanted to keep it legal,’ McCormick tells Dailymail.com, adding: ‘It’s part of my life; I use it for anxiety, I use it for energy. I’m a pretty motivational stoner.’\n\nHe worked in the restaurant and event industry before starting his business.\n\n‘I always wanted to bring the two together, and there was this stigma – so I wanted to break that stigma down … you know, the social part of it, what comes with cannabis and with weed. And so i wanted to break those barriers; I wanted to break those walls. I want to change it. I want a joint to be just like a bottle of Bud Light at a bar.’\n\nHe sourced the venue for Jeff and Serena’s wedding; despite the legality of marijuana, many locations are unwilling to host events that include cannabis consumption. In Colorado, however, Koop has already seen that change – fast.\n\n‘In the beginning, it was about one in 10 venues would be open-minded about cannabis weddings’ in the state, says Koop, who co-runs Irie Weddings & Events, tells DailyMail.com. ‘It’s a completely different thing. We went from four years ago, literally having, I would say, eight venues that we could work with; now we’re up to 60 venues in Colorado alone that are cannabis friendly.\n\n‘Half the time, it’s just having the right conversations with the venue owners to convince them, “hey – if you turn away this business, then somebody else is getting their money. Number two, it’s not your right to choose how they want to consume or enjoy their night; it’s theirs. And number three, half the time, if they’re consuming, chances are they’re not going to be as rowdy and drunk as they might be if it was an alcohol only wedding – so it actually decreases the cost of your total alcohol cost, as well as keeping people a little more sane, if you believe it or not.”’\n\nShe explains: ‘What we do is we regulate the way that cannabis is served and to what potency it is. We suggest our clients are purchasing very specific strains to set on specific onsets and feelings.\n\n‘We can literally orchestrate an entire evening based on cannabis strains. We can have you chatty and giggly in the beginning; we can have your mouth salivating as the food comes out; and then we can have you ready for the dance party. And then we can get you ready for that night cap to go home and relax.’\n\nMcCormick’s Flower Daddy offers different packages from which couples can pick and choose; for an upcoming wedding, he says, he’ll simply set up an edible table.\n\n‘With Serena and Jeff, they got the full package, because we’re doing everything,’ he says. ‘Everything is going to be cannabis.’\n\nKoop tells DailyMail.com that her business has quadrupled – she swears it’s increased by 420 percent, a synchronous nod to the stoner ‘weed day’ of April 20 – and she’s noticed the plant becoming more and more socially accepted.\n\n‘I think it’s past a trend; I think it’s turned into a tradition,’ she says. ‘There’s a lot of ways that people are incorporating it into their ceremonies – part of like their sacrament and their unity.\n\n‘I would say one of the biggest proving … pinnacle moments was when we got booked by some clients last year who don’t personally consume – but they wanted their guests to have the Colorado experience. So they booked us. The fact that they were open-minded enough, that they were like, “Well, we’ll spend extra money on this because everybody wants to know, everybody has questions, we can’t answer every question they have about weed just because we live in Colorado” … that was a really big turning point that made it seem like it was past the trend.\n\n‘The thing that we’re seeing is [at] every single wedding, we have first time consumers. We’ve not worked one wedding where we haven’t had one person who’s trying it for the first time … Two weeks ago, we had I think nine first time consumers at one wedding, which was one of our highest numbers, actually, for first time consumers.’\n\nFor Jeff and Serena’s wedding, they made it explicit on their invitations that the celebration would be heavily focused on marijuana – without any negative reaction, even from older relatives.\n\nHer mother, she says, ‘was very open to it.’\n\n‘She said I can celebrate in whichever way that I want,’ Serena tells DailyMail.com. ‘She asked me: Is it safe?” And I think that’s everyone’s biggest concern – is it safe? And I always say, of course it is. There’s always going to be people who are going to be at the wedding to guide people through and talk about dosages and things like that.\n\n‘Again, even with the alcohol comparison, alcohol can also be very unsafe in so many situations – and I think it should be looked at the same. It’s things that you wouldn’t do while drinking, don’t do them while you’re high.’\n\nThe new bride says: ‘I think the whole industry, as it is, it’s huge. I think even this moment is huge; it’s like the lifting of the prohibition of alcohol … I can see where people’s fears are coming from, but it’s literally the exact same way that people’s fears were with legalizing alcohol: Oh, we’re going to have more drunks. And it’s like, no, you’re not going to have more stoners.\n\n‘The people who like to stone are always going to stone, and the people who like to drink are always going to drink. I would love to walk into a bar in Los Angeles and it be a smoke lounge where you can just order from the bar like you normally would a drink and just select what kind of a strain you want and just sit with friends and socialize and have a good time.’\n\nThat was certainly the atmosphere at her own wedding, and both Serena and Jeff beamed throughout the night, more often than not with a joint in hand as they partied and danced with their family and friends.\n\nThe bride sums it up: ‘It’s a nice feeling to have, being buzzed and being in love.’",

The newspaper obtained two photographs, both showing men dressed in black holding AK-47s. One of the men is seen raising his index finger – a popular “salute” among Islamic State fighters and other jihadists. The refugees in question reportedly came from Dara province, which was liberated by the Syrian army in July.\n\nThe photos are currently being examined by the country’s security services and the suspected Islamic State members are being closely monitored, the paper said.\n\nREAD MORE: Asylum seeker gets 8yrs+ for brutal murder of teen in Germany\n\nThe discovery of the troubling photographs coincides with an official appeal to the EU for more help with migrants, with the small island nation warning it will be unable to cope if the influx of asylum seekers continues unabated. Cyprus has become a popular destination for asylum seekers, who reach the island by crossing into Turkey from Syria, and then embarking from the Turkish coast.\n\nThe country had received 4,022 asylum requests in the first eight months of 2018, which was 55% more than for the same period last year, according to Cypriot Interior Minister Constantinos Petrides.\n\nIn July, a boat carrying an estimated 150 migrants sank off the coast of Northern Cyprus.\n\nIslamic State militants or other jihadists claiming to be asylum seekers has been a cause for concern throughout Europe, especially in the wake of a massive influx of refugees brought about by the EU’s open-door migrant policy. In August it was revealed that a Yazidi girl who had fled from the Islamic State slavery in Iraq was confronted by her former captor in Germany, who was posing as an asylum seeker. The teenager returned to Iraq after deciding that Europe was not safe for legitimate refugees like her.\n\nREAD MORE: Former Yazidi sex slave recalls horror of meeting her ISIS rapist in Germany\n\nGermany in particular has struggled with crime and violence linked to asylum seekers, after the country opened its doors to more than a million migrants two years ago. A German court recently sentenced an asylum seeker to eight and a half years for the murder of a teen girl, and incidents like the 2016 Berlin Christmas market attack and the New Year’s Eve sexual assaults in Cologne have fuelled insecurities.\n\nLike this story?

          "body": "Turkey seems to have prevailed during tripartite talks with Russia and Iran, convincing the other parties that a major offensive in Syria's Idlib governorate would not be the wisest move at the moment.\n\nThe situation in Syria was discussed in Tehran on Friday by Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Russia's Vladimir Putin and Iran's Hassan Rouhani as part of the so-called \"Astana process.\" The leaders of Iran and Turkey disagreed on what action should be taken in Syria's Idlib, the last major stronghold of armed groups in the country, which is dominated by hardcore jihadists.\n\nAll three nations agree that the threat of radical Islamists in Syria must be eliminated, but differ as to how this should be achieved. Rouhani advocated a strong-arm approach, claiming it would secure an end to major hostilities in the seven-year-old conflict.\n\n\"We have to realize that only the destruction of the terrorists, a military victory against them, can ensure stability and peace in the future in Syria and not only in that country,\" he said.\n\nErdogan reiterated his government's concern over the potential death toll of an offensive in highly populated Idlib, where an estimated 3.5 million people are currently living. Turkey, which borders the Syrian governorate, is also objecting to a major operation there because it would likely cause a major exodus of refugees across the border, with extremists potentially sneaking in with refugees.\n\n\"[The refugees] would have no other way to go but Turkey. But we have already accepted 3.5 million refugees. Turkey cannot take in more,\" said President Erdogan.\n\n\"Our goal is to resolve the situation in Idlib according to the spirit of the agreements we made in Astana,\" Erdogan added, warning that \"mistakes in Idlib may derail the political process in Syria.\"\n\nThe Iranian president eventually agreed that civilians living in Idlib should not become victims of an anti-terrorist effort.\n\nAt Erdogan's suggestion, the final communique of the summit was amended to include a call for all armed groups in Idlib to lay down arms and seek a political transition in the country. Putin and Rouhani agreed, which may indicate that a major offensive in Idlib is not likely to be launched in the immediate future, unless some major development happens on the ground. The Russian president remarked that the call is addressed to all armed groups in the Syrian province, including UN-designated terrorist groups.\n\n\"Let us hope that the members of the terrorist organizations would have enough sense to stop resistance and lay down weapons,\" he said.\n\n\"Our agreements on Syria were always based on a premise that we are seeking to ensure peace between all belligerents, but kept the terrorist organizations bracketed out,\" he remarked.\n\nAs he was arguing against an offensive in Idlib, Erdogan acknowledged that armed groups controlling the governorate pose a credible threat, including to Russian military personnel stationed at Khmeimim Airbase. He suggested that regular drone attacks on the Russian military site should be stopped by pushing those launching them out of range.\n\nDuring the summit, Rouhani and Erdogan were united in their criticism of the presence of US troops in Syria. The Iranian president repeatedly stressed that foreign influence was a major factor in escalating the war in Syria, and called on the US to withdraw the troops that it has illegally deployed in Syria. Erdogan reiterated Ankara's objection to the support that the US gives Kurdish militias in northern Syria, which are perceived as a major security threat by the Turkish government.\n\nPutin's remarks on the situation in Syria tilted towards humanitarian aspects and the necessity to reconstruct the country. He said that many people who had fled violence in Syria to other nations may now return to their homes.\n\n\"Conditions have been made in Syria to take in up to a million of refugees. The government has provided security guarantees to all returnees, assuring that they would not be subjected to discrimination, including in terms of property rights,\" he said.\n\nThe Russian president argued that, if as many Syrians as possible get a chance to return to peaceful lives, it would give an impetus to a political resolution of the conflict between the Syrian government and the so-called \"moderate opposition.\" Erdogan disagreed with Putin, saying that the return of refugees to Syria would only be possible after a new constitution is agreed and adopted, and an election held to form a new government.\n\nRussia, Turkey and Iran are seeking to end violence in Syria and facilitate negotiations between its government and opposition groups, which agree to cease hostilities and seek a political transition for their country. The desired outcome is a peaceful Syria under a government that properly represents all its minorities and is in control of all its territory. The final resolution of the conflict, which was greatly complicated by foreign interference and the rise of jihadist groups, is expected to be negotiated in Geneva under the aegis of the UN.\n\nto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won’t tell you.",

Sistani, 88, the ultimate authority for most members of Iraq’s Shiite majority, placed blame for the unrest with political leaders and said a new government should be formed, “different from its predecessors,” Reuters reported. Sistani has been known to intervene in politics when he sees the country’s future in danger. In his Friday prayer sermon read out by an aide he demanded an end to the use of violence against “peaceful protests” and placed the blame squarely on politicians for corruption, poverty and unemployment. At least 10 protesters have died since Monday in Basra, a city of 2 million people where residents complain that infrastructure has collapsed.",

          "body": "Profitability is what matters !\nDear Whalesburg community,\nRecently Whalesburg has been popping up in more and more forums and articles, its reputation growing as the best new project among mining solutions. But is it true? Is Whalesburg really the most profitable mining pool in the world? How could that be possible?\nThe ​​Lowest Uncle Rate\n​​As you may have read in one of our previous posts, we’ve significantly improved node performance in our pool. This has resulted in a massive uncle rate drop down to 9% when mining Ethereum and 2% when mining Ethereum Classic. For comparison, one of our competitors, a top 3 mining pool, currently has an uncle rate of about 35% on ETH and 7% on ETC.\n​​For those who aren’t familiar, the concept of “uncle blocks” arises from one of the characteristics of the Ethash algorithm. When two pools find the block at approximately the same time, the pool that was a bit behind is considered an “uncle” and receives around 60% of the usual block reward. ​​This happens especially when a pool experiences time lags. Lags of 1–3 seconds are pretty normal and sometimes even large pools suffer from 15–20 second lags.\n​​These time lags, in combination with the small amount of time between blocks in the Ethereum network, result in an “uncle rate” of about 35% for some large pools; meaning 35% of the blocks won by those pools are in fact uncle blocks. For some reason, this situation is often neglected by miners, but it shouldn’t be. Let’s look at the numbers to illustrate just how big of an affect uncle blocks have on miners’ profitability.\nFor simplicity, let’s round up the Ethereum network block reward to 3 ETH and assume that an uncle block reward is 2 ETH. Now let’s consider a pool that has, like our competitor, a 35% uncle block rate, meaning 35 out of the 100 latest blocks are uncle blocks:\nIn this case miners in the “top 3” pool will only get and share:\n65х3+35х2=195+70=265 ETH.\nMeanwhile Whalesburg miners will get and share:\n91х3+9х2=273+18=291 ETH.\nThis means our pool is 9,8% more profitable even now while it is still at MVP stage after just two months of development beyond the token sale! ​​Thus Whalesburg is in fact the most profitable pool in the world among Ethash mining pools. All data are from the Ethereum blockchain so you can easily verify yourself.\n​​Sales Plan and Strategy\n​​As you may have noticed, last week our pool hashrate dramatically increased to 120 GH/s. \n​​Based on our sales plan we were going to start attracting new miners from next month but current miners’ interest was higher than our expectations. ​​This is the direct result of hiring three sales managers and starting sales development.\n​​Also, we have worked out a partnership program for early supporters who have demonstrated a great deal of commitment and helped us to promote the product. ​​To show our gratitude we are ready to propose the following special conditions: a lifetime percentage of the income of miners referred by our earliest supporters. Please refer to our Telegram chat for more details.\n​​At the moment we are attracting partners and getting super helpful feedback in order to improve our interface and user experience. Our next step is to attract more miners across Europe, the USA and Russia. We are planning to get the most out of these areas by the end of this year. In the beginning of 2019 we are planning expansion to Asia, with an initial focus on China, Korea, Japan. In mid-2019 we will also consider other regions based on our priorities and the evolving landscape.\nAchievements So Far\nThis year we worked hard. To summarise all our release notes, the most important features are:\n​​We mine an algorithm, not a coin. When you connect to Whalesburg you can forget about having to find the most profitable coin by constantly calculating profits in a shifting environment. The Whalesburg pool is doing it for you. Automatically.\n​​Algo-wide PPLNS is a UNIQUE Whalesburg feature. This is what we meant by «profit-switching mining pool based on game theory». Miners mine different coins, but take their reward as a team using our unique PPLNS method.\nWe have the ​​lowest possible uncle rate. This a feature that is sure to take the mining world by storm. We bet this will be a key parameter used to compare pools in the near future. For now. incomprehensibly, only a few people care about it. This means we have a huge advantage.\n​​System architecture has been reworked. We have a new mining pool engine that includes an improved Stratum protocol to support multi-algo and multi-coin switcher on the server-side.\nWe built our own code from the ground up. The Whalesburg mining pool is a 100% proprietary solution. We use GoLang but the team reworked it from scratch to achieve maximum reliability.\n​Constantly evolving user-friendly ​UI/UX. Talking to miners on a regular basis helps us to build the perfect interface where our clients can get the real-time data they need. Our goal is to make mining splendid and this is how we achieve it.\n​​Last but not least: profitability! A year ago we were telling everyone that we would help them achieve higher profitability. Well here it is: just connect to our pool and enjoy. …Then call a friend and enjoy together :)\nStat with us and help us to improve further!\nWe appreciate your support!\nJoin #whalesburg:",

No one has reported seeing him since.\n\nThe disappearance of Arjen Kamphuis, 46, has so far flummoxed a widening police investigation that has chased stray clues and false leads in Norway, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. Norwegian police have released statements saying that they have no idea whether he was a victim of foul play, but that they “are open to all possibilities.”\n\nThe uncertainty, and Mr. Kamphuis’s links to WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy organization that has run afoul of governments and other powerful interests, has the internet buzzing with conspiracy theories. Some suggest a kidnapping — or worse — involving Russia, the C.I.A., MI6, Islamists or the Clintons, while others ask if he intended to disappear, possibly on some secret assignment for WikiLeaks.\n\nOther spurs to speculation include that Bodo, the town where he was last seen, is home to Norway’s main military air base, that the armed forces’ joint operations center is nearby, and that part of the country’s cyberdefense center is hidden in a mountain outside town. Investigators have ruled out any connection between the military presence and his disappearance.",

          "body": "Dev Letter #23 — Worker security: What is sandboxing and why do we need it?\niExec uses Intel SGX technology to protect the application from the worker, but what protects the worker from the application? Is the isolation of a Docker container enough? What are the current Sandbox solutions available for iExec, and how to install them?\n‘Sandbox’ is a security mechanism that separates programs that are running and executes them in a secure environment . This mechanism permits to execute untrusted applications issued from untrusted parties without putting the host machine at any risk.\nCurrently iExec launches jobs or tasks by packing them into ‘Docker containers’. Docker containers allow for some isolation for application execution environment, but we consider this isolation not sufficient. We are still presented with the problem that all docker containers share the same kernel as the host machine. Many kernel vulnerabilities are discovered each year (more than 400 in 2017 alone!). The problem is that third parties have the opportunity to exploit a kernel vulnerability and compromise the host’s Operating System.\nIn the case of iExec’s distributed cloud environment, when the host’s OS is compromised, one of the worst attacks is to steal a worker’s wallet. We therefore need additional protection mechanisms to protect workers from potentially dangerous applications.\nPotential Solutions\nA number of solutions have been studied and considered to protect workers within the iExec network.\nDocker Hardening\nAn initial idea was to use Linux out-of-box security modules to enhance the security of docker containers. We experimented with SELinux, AppArmor and Seccomp in order to prevent container breaches from affecting host operating systems. This solution allowed the specification of a fine-grained security policy for a docker container.\nHowever, the main disadvantage of this solution was that it was nearly impossible to define relevant policies to address all scenarios, especially the execution of unknown applications. This solution therefore can not be applied within the iExec ecosystem.\ngVisor\nDeveloped by Google, ‘gVisor’ is a user-space kernel for containers. gVisor intercepts the application system calls and acts as a guest kernel. It implements most kernel primitives and has system call handlers built on top of these primitives. With this solution, the application executed uses user-space kernel that is separate from host kernel.\nTo provide ‘defense-in-depth’, gVisor employs rule-based execution. As a result, it provides much more security than a simple docker execution. However, gVisor user-space kernel doesn’t implement all kernel primitives and uses ‘ptrace’ to control the application execution. As a result, it has reduced application compatibility and has a higher per-system call overhead. As iExec aims to provide the efficient execution of any type of application, this solution was discarded as well.\nHardware Virtualization\nToday, one of the most secure application separation mechanisms available is hardware virtualization. Virtualization creates an abstraction layer between the software and the hardware. Virtualized computing resources are provisioned into isolated instances. Every instance is logically isolated. This means a malware attack of an instance won’t affect the host machine or other instances. This instances are called Virtual Machines or ‘VM’s for short.\nThe problem with hardware virtualization using VMs is that you must prepare in advance the execution environment for your specific application. So if your application has some special library requirements you will need to prepare a special VM image and package your application into it. In addition, the traditional VMs have a large footprint and long startup time. So pure hardware virtualization is not a suitable solution for iExec. iExec needs a mix between container and hardware virtualization technologies.\nKata Containers\nKata Containers are a new open source project building extremely lightweight virtual machines that seamlessly plug into the container’s ecosystem. It provides both the security of VMs and the speed of containers. This solution combines technology from Intel Clear Containers and Hyper runV. It is designed to be hardware-agnostic and is compatible with Open Container Initiative (OCI) and Container Runtime Interface (CRI). This means it can be used with both Docker and Kubernetes.\nKata containers solve the problem of traditional VMs’ large footprint size and provide a container-comparable startup time. In Kata Containers, every container has its own lightweight VM providing isolation with hardware virtualization. So Kata Containers give us at the same time the security of hardware virtualization, and the convenience of using containers.\nHardware virtualization needs a hypervisor to provide an abstraction layer between the software and the underlying hardware. Kata Containers are designed to support multiple hypervisors, and now works with QEMU/KVM.\nToday, QEMU/KVM among other open source virtualization solutions has the better support of GPU virtualization and has the Intel SGX compatibility.\nDespite the fact that Kata containers have limited compatibility with already virtualized environments, this solution is worth considering if you want to be an iExec worker and feel safe about your  Kata Containers\nSupported platforms\nHardware\nBare Metal (Intel VTX, ARM Hyp Mode, IBM Power Systems)\nVirtualized environment with nested virtualization enabled\n\nOS\nCentOS\nFedora\nRed  process\nWe prepared a script which will do all of the installation job for you. We called it the iExec Kata worker installation script. It will install all the necessary packages and configure your environment for iExec Kata worker launch.\nFirst, our script will install if required:\nDocker Engine\nKata Containers\niExec Worker\n\nIt will then prepare a Docker environment to execute worker tasks in Kata containers.\nYou will also be able to configure vCPU number and RAM quantity which will be used for each task execution.\nTo install iExec Kata worker environment just run our script:\nsudo  After installation of iExec Kata worker, all docker containers will be executed inside Kata containers.\nTo remove Kata containers and restore docker environment:\nsudo  now, prepared scripts can be launched on any Ubuntu and some Debian operating systems. If you are interested in iExec Kata worker installation at other operating system you have two choices:\nYou can ask us and we will release the next version of this script which will work with all operating systems supported by Kata containers\nYou can use the official Kata containers documentation and do it yourself.\n\niExec Kata worker scripts can be found on our GitHub:\nLaunching an iExec worker\nThe iExec worker is launched with the default docker runtime and not in Kata container. We are considering that the worker can be started as a normal docker container at the host machine without any risk.\nOn the other hand, all tasks executed by a worker must be sandboxed. So they will be automatically launched by workers in Kata Containers.\nTo launch an iExec Kata Worker for a Workerdrop:\ndocker run — restart always \\\n — runtime runc \\\n — hostname kata-worker-$HOST \\\n — env  \\\n — env SCHEDULER_IP=52.52.233.12 \\\n — env LOGIN=worker \\\n — env PASSWORD=K2ovTKF6mfHbDx5kDsyi \\\n — env LOGGERLEVEL=INFO \\\n — env SHAREDPACKAGES= \\\n — env SANDBOXENABLED=true \\\n — env BLOCKCHAINETHENABLED=true \\\n — env SHAREDAPPS=docker \\\n — env TMPDIR=/tmp/iexec-worker-drop \\\n — env WALLETPASSWORD=WALLET_PASSWORD \\\n -v  \\\n -v  \\\n -v  \\\n iexechub/worker:latestMore information can be found at: https://docs.iex.ec/\nFollow Us\nWebsite • Blog • Slack • Telegram • Reddit • Twitter • Facebook • LinkedIn• Youtube • Github • Kakao • Instagram • Steemit • Katacoda • Docs",

          "body": "The dating world can be a minefield to navigate.\n\nAnd it seems online dating throws up even more obstacles than attempting to forge a romantic connection in real life.\n\nWomen around the world have been sharing their biggest gripes about dating websites and apps on Reddit - from being catfished to being bombarded with unsolicited nude pictures.\n\nThey were responding to a request for singles to share their experiences of online dating on the internet forum, and anyone contemplating dipping a toe into the world of Tinder might think again after reading the contributions.\n\nOne woman described the number of attached men she's encountered on dating websites as 'sickening', while another said she was told she was a 'bad person' for being frank about only wanting to date men without children.\n\nSeveral women shared their disgust at the number of men using dating apps to cheat on wives or partners.\n\nOthers were dismayed by the constant demands for sex and casual hook-ups rather than more meaningful relationships.\n\nAnother popular complaint, one that applied to both men and women, were the number of people using dating apps as ego boosts and just matching with people without any intention of pursuing a real-life connection.\n\nOne user commented: 'I don't want to be your unicorn for a threesome. I don't want to facilitate you cheating on your wife. I don't want to be your random hookup.'\n\nIn dating, the term unicorn hunting usually refers to couples who search for a woman to have a threesome with them.\n\nAnother woman wrote: 'The disgusting explicit messages, especially the fetishizing ones. I see why so many women quit after just a couple of days on these sites. OkCupid is infinitely worse than Tinder with regard to this.\n\n'Also, the ridiculous amount of married/otherwise attached men. It's sickening.'\n\n'Even when I was looking for casual sex, only two people talked to me like I was human and not a sex toy. Disgusting.'\n\nOther complaints about dating apps shared by the women included frustration that people don't seem to read profiles or be at all considerate in conversation.\n\nOne user said: 'Dudes either not reading my profile, or choosing to ignore stuff in it. Or reading it and then mentioning things in it that I say I'm not looking for and then asking me if it's actually a dealbreaker.'\n\nAnother woman agreed and said: 'When I did online dating I very politely said I wasn’t interested in dating people with kids. The amount of messages I got trying to change my mind about that or telling me what a bad person I am was astonishing. I just assumed all of those people were awful parents.'\n\nA third woman added: 'Anytime you mention a dealbreaker they want to argue about it as if that will change your mind. This also happens on reddit which I just find so weird. Who cares what my dealbreaker is, why are you trying to date someone who doesn't want to date you?'\n\nSome women also complained about how dating apps just seem to be a game for people.\n\nOne said: 'It’s honestly just like a game to most people. There are so many people available to you at any given time that most people end up dating/seeing multiple people at the same time. With that, the idea of eventually committing to one person is difficult because you still have so many “options” at your disposal. This goes for both guys and girls.'\n\nAnother added: 'A lot of guys seem to be using them as a socialization, validation video game and an easy-hookup search tool. Not actually to date or make a friend.\n\nAnd when it IS for dating, they treat it like speed dating of some sort. You will have one conversation, maybe not even that, then go on a date or they're out.'\n\nA third woman said: 'Most of them just want to type back and forth, once phone numbers are swapped, they just want to text. Getting together face to face is like pulling teeth with various ridiculous reasons given.\n\n'Eventually I decided if a meeting wasn’t made within 2-3 weeks, I quit. If you don’t make the time to meet me for 1 hour in that time, you do not have time for any type of relationship with me.'",

Wardle does a deep dive into how Adware Doctor works on his blog Objective-See, which you can check out here, but essentially, the app sidesteps Apple's sandboxing features and snags browser histories from Chrome, Firefox and Safari. \"Now, an anti-malware or anti-adware tool is going to need legitimate access to user's files and directories -- for example to scan them for malicious code,\" Wardle explains. \"However, once the user has clicked 'Allow,' since Adware Doctor requested permission to the user's home directory, it will have carte blanche access to all the user's files. So yes will be able to detect and clean adware, but also collect and exfiltrate any user file it so chooses!\"\nWardle points out the the app is in violation of Apple's App Store Rules  Guidelines. But though he notified Apple of the issue a month ago, it's still available on the App Store, which is troubling to say the least. Stealing users' browser histories is a serious privacy issue and \"rather f#@'d up,\" as Wardle puts it.",

(AP) - President Donald Trump is traveling to Mississippi next week to campaign for a Republican seeking to finish the final two years of a U.S. Senate term.\n\nCindy Hyde-Smith faces three challengers in a November special election, and the race could be important as Republicans try to maintain their majority. The Trump campaign announced Friday that he'll appear at a rally for her Sept. 14 in Jackson.\n\nRepublican Gov. Phil Bryant appointed Hyde-Smith, the second-term state agriculture commissioner, to temporarily succeed 80-year-old Sen. Thad Cochran when the longtime lawmaker resigned in April.\n\nFILE - In this Aug. 2, 2018, file photo, U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., speaks at one of the biggest political events of the year in the state, the Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia, Miss. Hyde-Smith, was appointed by Gov. Phil Bryant to assume the position until an election could be held to fill the post. All three challengers are accepting two debate invitations for a U.S. Senate race in Mississippi, but it's unclear if the Republican incumbent Cindy Hyde-Smith will take part. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis, File)\n\nTrump won Mississippi in 2016 and tweeted his \"complete and total Endorsement\" of Hyde-Smith last month.\n\nIf no candidate receives a majority in the Nov. 6 election, the top two advance to a Nov. 27 runoff.",

          "body": "WASHINGTON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Barack Obama will jump back into the political fray on Friday, telling Democratic voters the stakes are too high to sit out November's elections, when the party is seeking to wrest control of Congress from President Donald Trump's Republicans.\n\nObama has largely avoided the spotlight since Trump succeeded him last year. But a speech on Friday at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will mark the start of a flurry of activity as he hits the campaign trail on behalf of Democratic candidates in critical races.\n\nThe Nov. 6 election is widely seen as a referendum on Trump. While the president touts fulfilled campaign promises such as tax cuts and deregulation, his tenure has been clouded by a widening probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, and growing questions about his behavior and fitness for office, even by some within his administration.\n\nBoth parties traditionally see a large drop-off in turnout in non-presidential election years, but Democrats and Republicans alike are trying to energize voters with talk of high stakes.\n\nDemocrats need to pick up 23 seats to win a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives and two seats in the U.S. Senate. Control of one or both chambers would allow them not only to foil Trump's agenda but also to open congressional investigations into his administration.\n\nDemocratic control of the House would also allow the party to press impeachment proceedings, although the party has broadly steered clear of making that threat.\n\nDespite that, Trump starkly told his supporters on Thursday to stave off any impeachment proceedings against him by keeping Republican majorities in Congress.\n\n\"It's so ridiculous,\" he told a rally in Montana, referring to impeachment. \"But if it does happen, it's your fault, because you didn't go out to vote. OK? You didn't go out to vote. You didn't go out to vote. That's the only way it could happen.\"\n\nObama, in his speech, will press Americans to turn out in November, saying \"this moment in our country is too perilous for Democratic voters to sit out,\" according to his spokeswoman Katie Hill.\n\nThe former Democratic president, following tradition, has so far been reluctant to publicly criticize his successor, to the frustration of some Democrats. Last week, he appeared to chide Trump, without naming him, in a eulogy for the late Republican Senator John McCain.\n\nObama will appear at a campaign event in Southern California this weekend before heading to Ohio next week and, later in September, to Illinois and Pennsylvania.",

          "body": "CLOSE\n\n\n\n\n\n    When a homeless man gave his last $20 to a stranded couple in Philadelphia, they started a Gofundme campaign for him raising nearly $400K. But now, lawyers are involved and the money is missing.\n    USA TODAY\n\n\n\nIn this Nov. 17, 2017, photo, Johnny Bobbitt Jr., left, Kate McClure, right, and McClure's boyfriend Mark D'Amico pose at a Citgo station in Philadelphia. When McClure ran out of gas, Bobbitt, who is homeless, gave his last $20 to buy gas for her. McClure started a GoFundMe campaign for Bobbitt that ultimately raised more than $400,000.(Photo: Elizabeth Robertson/Associated Press)\n\n\nFLORENCE, N.J. – While the legal battle continues over nearly a half-million dollars in online donations for a homeless Samaritan, the crowdfunding platform that hosted the campaign is vowing the Philadelphia man will get his money.\nGoFundMe, the online site used to raise the money, has made a commitment to see that homeless veteran John Bobbitt Jr. gets all of the $402,000 raised last year to help him.\n“We are pleased to report that Johnny will be made whole and we’re committing that he’ll get the balance of the funds that he has not yet received or benefited from,\" the online fundraising company announced Thursday night in a joint statement with Cozen O’Connor, the law firm representing Bobbitt in a civil lawsuit filed only last week in an effort to retrieve all of the funds.\n\"GoFundMe’s goal has always been to ensure Johnny gets the support he deserves.\"\nSept. 6: Court orders deposition for couple who raised $400K for homeless man\nThe promise comes on the same day investigators descended on the New Jersey home of the couple who kicked off the viral campaign last year.\nOn Thursday morning, Burlington County, New Jersey, law enforcement authorities executed a search warrant at the Florence, New Jersey, home of Katelyn McClure and Mark D'Amico, the couple who raised the money after Bobbitt helped her when she was stranded last fall in Philadelphia.\n\"We’ll continue to assist with the ongoing law enforcement investigation,\" the GoFundMe statement continued.\n\"As we’ve said, our platform is backed by the GoFundMe Guarantee, which means that in the rare case that GoFundMe, law enforcement or a user finds campaigns are misused, donors and beneficiaries are protected. We’re fulfilling that commitment today and we will continue to work with Johnny’s team to make sure he’s receiving all donated amounts.\"\nLaw enforcement officials offered little information about the criminal investigation.\nLaw enforcement authorities executed a search warrant Thursday, Sept. 6, 2018, at the Florence, New Jersey, home of Katelyn McClure and Mark D'Amico. (Photo: Chris LaChall, (Cherry Hill, N.J.) Courier Post)\n\nBurlington County Prosecutor Scott A. Coffina confirmed in a brief statement that investigators from his office worked with Florence Township police in executing the search warrant, \"in connection with a criminal investigation,\" into the case.\n\"As of this time, there have been no charges filed,\" Coffina said in the statement Thursday morning. \"Further updates will be provided as circumstances warrant.\"\nBobbitt, a homeless veteran from Philadelphia, has sued McClure and D'Amico to recover much of the $402,000 they solicited through an online crowdfunding campaign late last year.\nSept. 4: $400K raised for homeless man on GoFundMe is gone, attorney says\nEarlier this week, Bobbitt's attorney said he learned all of the money is gone. He could not be reached for comment Thursday on the criminal investigation development.\nBobbitt met McClure in November when she ran out of gas on an exit ramp of Interstate 95 in Philadelphia. The homeless man used his last $20 to walk to a station to buy her gas.\nMcClure and D'Amico took him food and gifts, and later started the online fundraiser for Bobbitt that eventually went viral as news of his good deed spread.\nMore than 14,000 people contributed to the campaign.\nA \"No Trespassing\" sign sits at the Florence, New Jersey, home of Katelyn McClure and Mark D'Amico, whose home was searched by authorities Thursday, Sept. 6, 2018. (Photo: Chris LaChall, (Cherry Hill, N.J.) Courier Post)\n\nIt's not yet clear what police were looking for at the couple's home, but a local TV reporter posted video of a BMW in the driveway being loaded onto a truck and investigators were seen removing boxes of materials from the property. The couple was home at the time of the search.\nA \"no trespassing\" sign was posted Thursday on the edge of the property.\nIn Superior Court on Wednesday, Judge Paula T. Dow ordered the couple to provide to the court by Friday afternoon documentation on how much of the donations has been spent, how it was used and what remains.\nAug. 31: Judge orders couple to give money from GoFundMe campaign to homeless man\nThe judge also directed the couple to give sworn statements in legal depositions Monday about their handling of the money, some of which the couple's defense lawyer Ernest Badway confirmed was co-mingled with his clients' personal funds.\nBadway indicated in court Wednesday that his clients intend to invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refuse to give testimony about where the money went.\nBadway did not respond to requests for comment Thursday.\nIt's unclear whether the criminal probe will impact the judge's civil court orders.\nMcClure and D'Amico have claimed they spent roughly $200,000 on Bobbitt by buying him a trailer and a used vehicle, and providing him with living expense money that he partly used to buy drugs and to give away to family.\nBobbitt claims he received only $75,000 in cash and the value of the truck and camper.\nChris Fallon, Bobbitt's attorney, admitted his client suffers from drug addiction and is now in a rehabilitation facility.\nAug. 25: Homeless again, man fears he'll never get most of the $400k from a GoFundMe in his honor\nThe camper had been parked on land that McClure’s family owns, but Bobbitt said he became homeless again after D’Amico told him in June that he had to leave the property.\nIn court last week, Bobbitt’s attorney said there was more than $150,000 in donations left, but Fallon said he learned in a subsequent phone conversation with Badway that the money was gone.\nA GoFundMe spokesman said the company is working with law enforcement to ensure Bobbitt gets all the money he is due. The company said it also put $20,000 in an account set up by his attorney to aid in his investigation.\nContributing: The Associated Press.

There are now more reasons than ever to make Tor your daily browser of choice.\n\nMore specifically, the Tor Browser has been updated to include the features pushed out in Firefox Quantum, which include a refreshed interface called Photon UI, and a speedier page rendering engine. The Tor Browser has always been based on Firefox, but is now right up to date with the modern look and code.\nFor the completely uninitiated, the Tor Browser is the key software program put out by the Tor Project, which manages  a network of nodes that essentially provide anonymity on the web. In a similar way to a VPN, Tor doesn’t connect you to websites directly, but via a series of other servers and encrypted connections.\nWhere it differs from a VPN is that it’s decentralized and manned by volunteers—you’re not trusting one VPN company with your connection and data. The Tor Browser program not only gives you easy access to these anonymous connections, it also keeps a close watch over cookies, scripts, ads and anything else that might be trying to track you.\nThe new Tor Browser\nThis latest update has been a long time coming: Firefox Quantum (Firefox 57) arrived in November 2017, with a fresh new look, an improved page rendering engine, and better APIs for browser add-ons. Implementing those substantial changes into the Tor Browser has taken a while for the small development team behind it.\nNow the wait is over with Tor Browser 8, which is available to download now.\nThe Tor team has added some updates specific to this browser too though, not least a new welcome screen for first-time users that aims to make the whole process of using the software easier than it has been in the past. Despite its excellent privacy features, the Tor Browser hasn’t been the most straightforward of browsers for casual users to understand.\nAnother major change is in the addition of a Tor Circuit button, which randomly changes the server being used to connect to the web. Previously, users had to deal with some confusing options; now it’s just a two-click process.\nTaken together—the refreshed Firefox Quantum interface, and the tweaks aimed at new users—the update means there’s never been a better time to give the Tor Browser a go.\nTor Browser 8 also simplifies the Bridge Fetching process, which is needed when the internet is blocked in whatever country you’re in. Rather than sending off an email or visiting a separate website, as was needed before, you can now connect to a bridge with a single click and a captcha form.\nThe new onboarding process explains all this very well. You get descriptions of what the Tor network is, how it helps preserve your anonymity, and what technical terms like circuits mean inside the browser.\nEveryday browsing with Tor\nIs the Tor Browser now a viable option for anyone? In a word, yes. Most of what you do on the web works exactly as it does in any other browser, with tabs and toolbar icons and the ability to initiate web searches from the address bar (though in this case it’s the privacy-focused DuckDuckGo rather than Google that handles searching duties).\nNew circuits can be established in a couple of seconds, and if you want to delve into Tor’s security settings, there are only three options to worry about: Standard, Safe, and Safest. Explanations of what each one includes are listed alongside, and you don’t need an IT security qualification to understand them.\nThere are some trade-offs: because of the extra rerouting going on, load times are slower, especially on the bigger and more complex sites. It’s not enough to make you want to throw your laptop out the window, but it is noticeable. And because Tor disables a lot of interactive web elements to limit how much the browser (and the sites you visit) can know about you, some parts of some sites will appear broken.\nThat said, we’ve been taking a tour with Tor today, across the likes of Twitter, Gmail, Google Docs, and the BBC, and everything works perfectly well. Much of the heavy lifting that Tor needs to do to keep your browsing secure and private is done in the background.\nTwo add-ons come with the Tor Browser: HTTPS Everywhere (to force HTTPS connections where available) and NoScript (restricting interactive elements on pages to limit the chance of browser attacks). As a result, pages can often look plainer and more stripped-down than they otherwise would.\nIt’s also worth noting that in a lot of respects, the Tor Browser works like an incognito window in Chrome—cookies and browsing history are deleted at the end of every session, so if you like the convenience of sites remembering you who are or are often jumping back through your web history, this might grate.\nTo be fair, the Tor Browser has always been pretty simple to use, being based on Firefox—but the update to the Quantum code, plus the couple of tweaks aimed at simplifying browsing for new users, definitely help. If you’ve given it a go in the past and come away unimpressed, take another look.\nPrivacy and security with Tor\nThe primary reason for getting the Tor Browser installed is to limit the amount of data that marketing firms, tech companies, government agencies, and your Internet Service Provider (ISP) are able to collect about you.\nIt’s perfect if you want to browse the web while leaving as small a digital trial as possible. If you sign into Gmail, Google is going to know about it obviously, but it won’t be able to tell where you’re logging in from or track you across multiple other sites at the same time through tracking cookies.\nThe Tor Browser also gives you access to the deep (or dark) web, providing extra layers of anonymity and protections against censorship. Browsing the deep web isn’t as simple as heading to regular URLs (you need to look up a hidden wiki to know where to head), and the latest Tor update doesn’t really change that. Recent research suggests that the number of dark web sites is in decline.\nEven with all these extra tools and protections built into the Tor Browser though, you’re never 100 percent guaranteed to be safe and anonymous online. The Tor network has been exploited before, and may well be again—government agencies know as well as anyone that people use Tor to stay hidden, and they’re always working on ways to keep tabs on users.\nWhile it’s much, much harder to track someone using the Tor Browser, it’s not impossible, so bear that in mind as you go about your daily browsing business. Remember that the only truly foolproof way of not having your web activities tracked is not to go online at all.\nHowever, for casual users who want to add a substantial amount of privacy and security protection to their daily browsing—without really giving up much in return—the new updates rolled out this week make the Tor Browser more compelling than ever.",
